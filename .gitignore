Does not the second *.dll (line 72) and packages (line 68) under # OS generated files # override whole this section (lines 12-16):

# Include dlls if they’re in the NuGet packages directory
!/packages/*/lib/*.dll
!/packages/*/lib/*/*.dll
# Include dlls if they're in the CommonReferences directory
!*CommonReferences/*.dll
?

Thanks so much - 2023 and it's a mystery why the dotnet new cli tool doesn't autogenerate a .gitignore to use 🤷
